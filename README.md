# Classic retro pong game built using Microsoft Unity 5
This project served as an introduction to coding games using Unity. It is still not complete as there are some bugs, but at the moment it is playable. If you wish to test out the game, simply pull this repository using Git and launch the pong.exe file. Have fun!

# Bugs
In the current version there are a few bugs affecting gameplay. The box colliders in the menu screen don't seem to be working 100% as the balls pass through the text mesh occassionally. However, this is simply an aesthetic issue.

As for the gameplay, the enemy A.I. occassionally hits the ball such that the pong ball will ricochet vertically between the walls forever. Additionally, the box colliders for the paddles themselves are a little too unforgiving and the enemy A.I. difficulty is set a bit high. 

These bugs will be fixed in a later version update.
